            """Imagine everything around you - your desk, the air you breathe, even the water you drink - they're all made of something called MATTER! Matter is like the building blocks of everything in the universe.

Matter comes in three main forms, kind of like ice cream comes in different flavors:

**Solids are Super Strong! 💪**
Solids keep their shape no matter what! Think about a rock, a book, or an ice cube. The tiny particles (we call them atoms and molecules) inside solids are packed together really tight, like students standing in a crowded hallway. They can only wiggle a tiny bit in place. That's why you can pick up a solid and it doesn't flow through your fingers!

**Liquids Love to Flow! 💧**
Liquids are the relaxed cousins of solids. They have a set volume (amount), but they'll take the shape of any container you put them in. Pour water into a cup - it becomes cup-shaped! Pour it into a bowl - now it's bowl-shaped! The particles in liquids are still close together, but they can slide past each other like people dancing at a party.

**Gases are Free Spirits! 💨**
Gases are the ultimate free spirits - they spread out to fill up any space they're in! The air around you is full of gases, but you can't see most of them. Gas particles zoom around super fast with lots of space between them, like kids running around in a huge playground.

The coolest part? The difference between these three states is all about how much energy the particles have and how close together they are!""",

**The Mantle: Earth's Gooey Middle! 🌋**
Below the crust is the mantle - the thickest layer of Earth! It's made of hot, dense rock that's so hot it flows veeeery slowly, like super thick honey or lava lamp fluid. The mantle is about 2,900 kilometers thick! Even though it flows, it's not liquid - it's more like silly putty that moves over millions of years.
